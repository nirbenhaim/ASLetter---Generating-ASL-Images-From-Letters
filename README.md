## Background
 deep learning project - GAN which receives as input a letter in English and produces an image containing the letter as it is indicated in sign language (American Sign Language).

* In order to use the GAN without traning eval = True, model_path and data_path contains the wanted directory, and in order to get specific letter implement it in chosen_letter. 
* In order to retarin the GAN eval = False, model_path and data_path contains the wanted directory.

### Inference & Visual Results
* In order  
* run `python main.py`


## TensorBoard

TensorBoard logs are written dynamically during the runs, and it possible to observe the training progress using the graphs. In order to open TensoBoard, navigate to the source directory of the project and in the terminal/cmd:

`tensorboard --logdir=./runs`

* make sure you have the correct environment activated (`conda activate env-name`) and that you have `tensorboard`, `tensorboardX` installed.
